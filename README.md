The following were projects from college.
The C4 project was web scraping, sentiment & NLTK project. 
Our goal was to scrape reviews from a popular product, In this case, I selected C4 preworkout.
Based on the reviews, we needed to determine the sentiment of the customers. Some of the popular words were jittery, sweaty, energetic, focused, anxious and much more.
